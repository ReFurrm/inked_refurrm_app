- AI Actions: Clarify: Make a paragraph clearer but keep the voice.
- AI Actions: Sharpen: Shorten, cut filler, land the punch harder.
- AI Actions: Turn up the emotion: Raise intensity without melodrama.
- AI Actions: Tone check: Does this sound like me or a corporate memo?
- AI Actions: Interrogate this scene: Ask questions like a smart editor, such as What were you afraid of here? and What did you want but did not admit?
- Stacked AI Actions: Let users stack actions: Clarify → then Sharpen → then Tone check.
- Side by side view: Original on the left, AI revision on the right, with changes highlighted.
- Admin Desk: Group the admin generators (letters, emails, forms, presentation outlines, summaries, social posts) into one calm place. Each template pre-filled with project context.
- Light Mode: Focus on speed, clarity, and basic polish for admin and marketing tasks. Treat requests like tasks, not therapy. Be more aggressive about structure and rephrasing, keep questions minimal.
- Standard Mode: Balance voice, emotion, and clarity for drafting and editing. Preserve the user’s natural tone while fixing structure, flow, and grammar. Lightly expand, cut, or rearrange content, ask focused questions only when needed.
- Deep Mode: Sensitive or emotionally complex work: Write with clear, human logic, focus on cause and effect, real world consequences, and believable reactions. Treat the user as the source of truth, mirror, organize, and clarify what they give you instead of rewriting their reality. Use this as a tool.
